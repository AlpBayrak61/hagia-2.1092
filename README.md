What is Hagia?

Hagia is a 2D game engine and toolset for Python. made by 0xSTAR and AlpBayrak61

Hagia has two tools:

    Sprite Editor
    Map Editor

Unfortunately, Hagia does not provide a way of making music with it's toolset. To do so, you will have to use any means you choose. Just make sure all the music and audio are in the correct formats (.ogg for music, .wav for sound effects).
